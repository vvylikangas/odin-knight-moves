# odin-knight-moves

This project calculates the shortest route for a knight on a chessboard between any two given squares. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the board and determine the minimum number of moves required to reach the target square.

## How It Works:

The knight's possible moves are predefined.
The program explores all potential moves starting from the initial position.
It tracks visited positions to avoid revisiting squares and loops.
Once the target position is reached, the path is printed, showing the sequence of moves the knight takes.
